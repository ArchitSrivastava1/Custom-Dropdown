Hello buddy, I hope you are doing great and creating awesome projects. Today I have brought a useful project for you. In this project, you will learn to create Custom Dropdown Select Menu using HTML CSS, and JavaScript. Yeah, HTML also provides us a select menu with the dropdown feature, but we will you will learn to make it more beautiful and fascinating.

A Select Menu is a combination of various options where the user has to choose what they like or need. This type of select menu can be made for infinite purposes for example to choose the gender, favorite food, clothes media, etc.

Letâ€™s have a quick look at the given image of [Custom Dropdown Select Menu] on the webpage. As you on the image, at the top side there is a section with text select media and at the bottom section, there are some lists of social media icons with names. Actually, at first, the section of the social media list will be hidden and when we click on the upper select media button then that social media list will appear. When we click on the social media list then its name will appear on the top bottom.
